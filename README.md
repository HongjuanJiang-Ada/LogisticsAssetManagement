# LogisticsAssetManagement

Prototype project for the logistics asset management backend system

## Basic feature: asset registration

I am trying to use MySQL for database and use ODBC connecting to database. But there is somting wrong. I cannot find the data in database.

## Feature 1: asset registration - addAsset()

Database: a table include asset_id, name, category and purchase date

### Improvement: centralize database interactions within a specific class to avoid multiple connections

Improve code mmaintainability and reduce redundancy
